# README.md Generator

## Description
The project began with the goal of creating an application that would assist me in creating README.md files for my github repositories. As a coder, I write README files quite often and it can be very repetitive at times. This project was designed to simplify and speed up that process. The app is run from the console and upon running, the user will be prompted for information about their repository. Once all the questions are answered, the README.md file inside of the assets folder will be dynamically updated with your repository information. The README can then be manipulated if the user desires, or it's contents can be copied into the user's own README.
## Installation
To install the dependencies:
1. Make sure that Node.js v16 or up is installed onto the computer. 
2. Open up Git Bash and cd into the project folder. Then, type in the command 'npm i' inside the console to install the generator's dependencies.
## Usage
After installing dependencies:
1. Cd into the assets folder and type 'node index.js' into the console to begin the application.
2. Answer all questions with information about your repository. 
3. The README.md file inside the assets folder will then update with that info.
4. Now, you have your dynamically generated README.md file to use within your repository!
